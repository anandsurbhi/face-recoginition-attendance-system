# face-recoginition-attendance-system

The main objective of this Innovative Project is a step towards Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where the prime focus is towards setting up an attendance and login software for library Management System without human interaction and as an alternative to the biometric attendance system.


The Face Detection and Face Recognition technology as developed here provides a solution to secure Attendance marking for students registered in the library during the ongoing pandemic to reduce human touch interaction. The future of facial recognition is growing. It would be no surprise to see this technology providing better security in the future and integrated into our daily lives.In addition to the face recognition based Attendance and Login System, we have built an Automated Library Management System. The project is implemented at theadministrative end, and thus only the administrator is guaranteed access.

objective:
The main objective of the Library Management System is to manage the details of Address,Member, Issues, Books, Students. It contains the entire library operations from issuing books to ordering the book records with a face recognition based student registration and attendance portal. The project aims to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the Address, Member, Librarian, Issues. The purpose of Library Management System is to automate the existing manual system with the help of computerized equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuabdata/information can be stored for a more extended period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. Here we have proposed a library management for facial recognition system to reduce the crowd of students in this not only in pandemic of coronavirus as well as for our daily usage also.The role of the library management system is to keep records of students and books. It maintains the catalog of the books. Manually,keeping records requires a lot of time ,effort,costand maintenance .Our problem statement is concerned with creating such a library management system so that it decreases our efforts,cost and management.So ,in order to so do we introduced computerised face recognition library management system in which the
student database is barcoded or registered with the face of the student 


PROJECT SCOPE

Face recognition systems work very well under constrained conditions, although all systems work much better with frontal images and constant lighting. All current face recognition algorithms do not do that good under the vastly varying conditions under which humans need to and are able to identify other people. Next generation person recognition systems will need to recognize people in constrained situations as well as adapt new modifications. The project is based on believe that identification systems that are robust in natural environments, in the presence of noise and illumination changes, cannot rely on a single modality, so that fusion with other modalities is essential. Technology used in smart environments has to be unobtrusive and allow users to act freely. Considering all the requirements, identification systems that use face recognition and speaker identification seemto us to have the most potential for wide-spread application. Cameras and microphones today are very small, light-weight and have been successfully
integrated with other systems. The researchers are beginning to look deep into the matter and to demonstrate that unobtrusive audio-and-video based person identification systems can achieve high recognition rates without requiring the user to be in highly controlled environments. Today, one of the fields that uses facial recognition the most is security. Facial recognition is a very effective tool that can help law enforcing organisations to recognize criminals and defaulters. Many software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access their technology and make the best use out of it. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials as and when needed as per the convenience of the organization.
